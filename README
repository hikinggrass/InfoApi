InfoApi V 0.1 

Info Api provides a simple API for youre Bukkit Server. There may already plugins out there doing that. But this is mine, and because it works great i share it 

Possible Api Querys:
http://server:25577/onlineplayer 
http://server:25577/onlineplayer/WORLDNAME 
http://server:25577/playerlist 
http://server:25577/playerlist/WORLDNAME 
http://server:25577/maxplayer 
http://server:25577/temp/WORLDNAME (Temperature at Spawn ) 
http://server:25577/time/WORLDNAME 
http://server:25577/onlinemode 
http://server:25577/version 
http://server:25577/say/text_to_say 
http://server:25577/cmd/cmd_attribute_another
each request needs its secret key at the end like: 
http://server:25577/version?secret

Example Usage PHP
PHP:
$apiurl = "http://server:25577/onlineplayer"
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $apiurl);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 1000);
$onlineplayer = curl_exec($ch);
echo $onlineplayer; 
Please note: this Plugin will give an Error if you do /reload, because the API Server CAN'T get reloaded at the moment. Thats not really an problem, but you should know. Also there can be an Error on Shutdown... im sorry about that

If somebody knows how i could convert Minecraft Time to real time, please say
